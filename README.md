Allows you to easily see what a href of a hyperlink is just by hover overing the text.

1. Download and unzip the files into a folder.
2. Go to [Google Extensions](chrome://extensions/) - chrome://extensions/.
3. Turn on Developer Mode (Top Right)
4. Click on `Load Unpacked` button.
5. Select the entire HoverRefs folder to upload.
6. Profit!

## List Of Things To Add Or Ideas
- Image Sizes (Height, Width, File Size)
- Broken Link Checker

## Things To Change
- Redesign the popup so that it's more clean and modular.
- Maybe format the files to be clean. Folder for images, folder for content.js, etc etc.
- Make hover refs dynamic so that we don't need to activate every time. (Toggle)

## List Of Bugs
- Using HTags after will result in that hover link being removed. Need a way to dynamically generate.
