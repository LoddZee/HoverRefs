# HoverRefs
Allows you to easily see what a href of a hyperlink is just by hover overing the text.

## Installing
This is a google extension. Click [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hoverrefs/hdnialhfhdejlkojhdaefeioojdlpknm) to install!

## List Of Things To Add Or Ideas
- Image Sizes (Height, Width, File Size)
- Broken Link Checker
- Highlight Links (Toggle)
- Check page if "No Index"
- Popup that displays any warnings needed, like the no-index, maybe if an image doesn't have alt text?
- Spelling and grammar checker
- Separate screen to see multiple devices at once

## Things To Change
- Redesign the popup so that it's more clean and modular.
- Maybe format the files to be clean. Folder for images, folder for content.js, etc etc.
- Make hover refs dynamic so that we don't need to activate every time. (Toggle)

## List Of Bugs
- Using HTags after will result in that hover link being removed. Need a way to dynamically generate.
